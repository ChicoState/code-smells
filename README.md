This document gives actual examples of *code smells* -- characteristics of code that are not bugs, but may indicate an underlying problem in the implementation. It is based on the code smell list compiled at [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/).

## Example (replace header title with the name of the code smell)

A brief summary of the code smell, described in plain language with a reason why it indicate a problem.

```{programming-language}
if( example == "good" )
