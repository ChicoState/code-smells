Speculative Generality

Implementing code that you believe will be useful for future use, so you implement
the code and never use the code or keep it for future use. Thus, this renders
the code useless and unneccesary.

EXAMPLE:
In our current app development for Sustainability Points; implementing FitBit API
and we never actually track footsteps.

Why is it considered harmful to the code?
Makes the code cluttered and could provide problems in the future.

How it should be fixed?
Compress the class into something that could be useful, or remove the code to
prevent any issues.
